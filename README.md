# Num

Num a recipe collection that gives you recipe suggestions based on what you recently picked (or rather, did not pick). There are some [Ideas](https://github.com/tourn/num/wiki/Healthy-varied-diet) around about trying to make sure the user eats a healthy variety of nutrients during the week.

It is intended to be run on dokku and probably runs on heroku as well.
